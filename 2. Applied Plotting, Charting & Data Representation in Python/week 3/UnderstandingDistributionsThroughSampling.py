# # Practice Assignment: Understanding Distributions Through Sampling
# 
# ** *This assignment is optional, and I encourage you to share your solutions with me and your peers in the discussion forums!* **
# 
# 
# To complete this assignment, create a code cell that:
# * Creates a number of subplots using the `pyplot subplots` or `matplotlib gridspec` functionality.
# * Creates an animation, pulling between 100 and 1000 samples from each of the random variables (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`) for each plot and plotting this as we did in the lecture on animation.
# * **Bonus:** Go above and beyond and "wow" your classmates (and me!) by looking into matplotlib widgets and adding a widget which allows for parameterization of the distributions behind the sampling animations.
# 
# 
# Tips:
# * Before you start, think about the different ways you can create this visualization to be as interesting and effective as possible.
# * Take a look at the histograms below to get an idea of what the random variables look like, as well as their positioning with respect to one another. This is just a guide, so be creative in how you lay things out!
# * Try to keep the length of your animation reasonable (roughly between 10 and 30 seconds).

plt.text(x1.mean()-1.5, 0.5, 'x1\nNormal')
plt.text(x2.mean()-1.5, 0.5, 'x2\nGamma')
plt.text(x3.mean()-1.5, 0.5, 'x3\nExponential')
plt.text(x4.mean()-1.5, 0.5, 'x4\nUniform')
